            <h1>Victor Baro Fernandez</h1>
<p>I am a senior iOS developer with over eight years of experience. I have been involved in 10 different iOS apps. Some of them, like <a href="https://jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a> or <a href="https://www.minube.com">Minube</a>, are big projects with millions of users and big teams (up to 12 iOS developers). Others, like <a href="http://panels.app">Panels</a> or <a href="http://thoughts.ink">Thoughts</a>, are projects that I built from scratch with a partner at <a href="http://produktstudio.com">Produkt</a>, a company we founded and for which I have been involved in 100% of the process.</p>
<br>
<p>Although I have experience across all areas of iOS Development, my strongest skills are related to the “front end” (e.g. User Interface & Experience, animations, interactions, etc). I like working close to the design team, create delightful animations and transitions and deliver the best user experience.</p>
<br>
<p>I have worked in Objective-C for many years, but during the last 3 to 4 years I have spent most of my time programming in Swift. </p>
<br>
<h2>Most relevant Experience</h2>
<h3>Jobandtalent app, Senior iOS Developer (2015 - present)</h3>
<p><a href="jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a> started as a job market and for the past 4 years it has pivoted to a digital temp staffing agency. Jobandtalent is currently operating in 7 countries and has more than 10 million users and 150.000 businesses. The iOS team is currently formed by 3 people (including me), but was once as large as 12.</p>
<br>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Build an app from scratch (using Swift 1.0) for companies to post jobs, manage candidates, update profiles, etc.
</li><li>Build a chat for companies and candidates to interact.
</li><li>Participate in a major refactor, moving from an Objective-C + ReactiveCocoa codebase to Swift.
</li><li>Lead a major UI framework project. We created <a href="https://jobandtalent.engineering/visualkit-ui-framework-74ab8aae0d42">VisualKit</a>, a set of tools and UI controls. VisualKit was the first step in our Xcode project to become more modular, improving testing and building times. It also helped the company to create a common visual language. 
</li><li>Jobandtalent was originally written in Objective-C with an extensive use of Reactive Cocoa. For the past 3 years we have been migrating to Swift, moving away from reactive programming, and changed the architecture several times. We have finally settled in a <a href="https://jobandtalent.engineering/ios-architecture-an-state-container-based-approach-4f1a9b00b82e">custom architecture implementation based on Flux</a>.
</li></ul>

<h3>Produkt, Co-Founder & iOS Developer (2014 - present)</h3>
<p>I founded Produkt, along with my partner<a href="twitter.com/fillito">Daniel Garcia</a>, a small iOS development studio. We worked with four different clients, in addition to develop our own apps. In a three-year period we released two products, Thoughts and Panels. To date, Produkt continues to support the development of both apps.</p>
<br>
<h4>Panels: Comic reader</h4>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Use of OpenCV to perform panel-by-panel navigation. Panels is capable of extracting individual panels and navigate through them, improving the user reading experience, specially for small screens like the iPhone.
</li><li>Extensive use of UICollectionView. Panels uses UICollectionView for the main library as well as for all different readers (currently 5). It has custom layouts, custom transitions between views, custom gestures to perform different actions, multiple cells, decorating elements, etc.
</li><li>Extensive use of Realm SDK.
</li><li>We hired a designer to create the first version of Panels, but since then I have been in charge of the app’s design.
</li><li>Keep Panels up-to-date with new iOS frameworks and features: 3D touch, drag&drop, Vision (for OCR) or SwiftUI.
</li><li>Panels is 100% written in Swift.
</li></ul>

<br>
<h4>Thoughts - Notes in an infinite canvas</h4>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Thoughts was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/story/id1373754288?l=en">featured as App of the Day</a> in many countries. This is a major achievement, since Thoughts was created by only two developers and one designer.
</li><li>Making an “infinite” canvas was a mathematical challenge. We had to think of a way of representing paths in an unconventional way. 
</li><li>Thoughts takes drawing to the next step. Drawing with the apple pencil or fingers feels natural and smooth; achieving this level of accuracy and performance took many attempts. Thoughts does not use PencilKit or other UIKit frameworks, it renders paths from raw data.
</li><li>Thoughts syncs drawings via iCloud, which is seamless for the user. We also manually manage any syncing error.
</li><li>Thoughts is 100% written in Objective-C.
</li></ul>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Storybeat, Co-founder & iOS Developer (2018 - present)</h3>
<p><a href="http://storybeatapp.com">Storybeat</a> started as a side project that I developed. The project has grown exponentially, achieving more than four million active users per month and many million downloads. Storybeat is now a company with a dedicated team. I handed over the iOS project and reduced my involvement. Storybeat is also on the Google store (created by an Android developer).</p>
<br>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Create an app from scratch that has been #1 free app in many countries.
</li><li>Storybeat handles video and image natively using AVFoundation; no external framework was used to perform these tasks.
</li><li>Extensive multimedia usage: Storybeat can create videos from images or other videos, combine images, make videos from live photos, and other additional features. 
</li><li>Storybeat is 100% written in Swift
</li></ul>

<br>
<h3>Freelance, iOS Developer (2012-2014)</h3>
<p>During my first two years as an iOS developer I worked for other companies as a freelance.</p>
<br>
<h4>Minube app</h4>
<ul><li>I joined a team of three iOS developers to help redesign Minube. 
</li><li>Minube had multiple projects and targets for iPhone and iPad. I had to quickly familiarize myself with their project and become part of their team.
</li></ul>

<br>
<h4>5-choice app</h4>
<ul><li>5-choice was an iPad app developed for the University of Sussex. 5-choice is a behavioral task that measures cognition. The results of this task have been published in two peer-reviewed journals, and distributed across multiple universities. The results of this task have been cited over 32 times.
</li><li>Extensive use of Core Data and Cocos2D (game framework).
</li><li>Design and development of the entire project.
</li><li>Worked with a team of academic researchers.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><i>The app has never been available on the App Store, it was only distributed internally.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>iOS teaching</h4>
<p>Taught three different courses at the <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/en">Ironhack School</a>. I taught basic concepts of iOS development, basic and advanced animation, UI, and autolayout. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Wake Up Challenge app</h3>
<p><a href="http://wakeupapp.victorbaro.com">Wake Up Challenge app</a> was my first app, which I developed and designed. It was released for iOS 5. Wake Up Challenge was an alarm; to turn it off the user had to complete one of five games. </p>
<br>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Extensive use of Core Animation: All five games were coded using UIKit, most of them using CALayers and Core Animation.
</li><li>Release a product from 0 to 100 by myself.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><i>The app is no longer available in the store.</i></p>
